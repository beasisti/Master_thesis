# **Bayesian spatio-temporal models for over-threshold ozone pollution in Lombardia**

This repository contains the code used for my Master's thesis at Politecnico di Milano, titled *Bayesian spatio-temporal models for over-threshold ozone pollution in Lombardia*. The research focuses on modeling the exceedance of ozone concentration thresholds across various locations in Lombardia (Northern Italy), aiming to identify environmental and meteorological factors influencing ozone levels.
